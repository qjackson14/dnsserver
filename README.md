<h2>What is DNS & Why It Is Needed:</h2>

DNS (Domain Name System) is a critical component of the internet infrastructure that translates human-readable domain names (like www.example.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (like 192.0.2.1). This process allows users to access websites and online services using easy-to-remember names rather than numerical IP addresses.

In a help desk role, understanding DNS is essential because many common network issues involve DNS-related problems, such as websites being inaccessible or slow to load. Help desk professionals often troubleshoot connectivity issues, resolve domain resolution errors, and ensure that DNS settings are correctly configured on client devices and network infrastructure. Efficient DNS management and problem-solving help maintain seamless internet and network access for users, which is vital for the smooth operation of any organization.
